Access to information is such a vital part of a healthy economy that it is one of the major roles of a free market government such as the US.  However, due to the current situation with the federal government, information provided by the federal government has slowed to a trickle. For example, the Trump administration has cut research and centered public information on climate change. With the slow of information from government sources, consumers need new sources of information about the products that they buy. U-Glass is the solution to this problem. U-Glass is a one-stop resource for consumers to get information on the impacts of the products that they buy. U-Glass will help American consumers achieve gathering better information about the products that they buy through providing an easily searchable and verifiable mobile database on the impacts of the products that they buy. With access to this information, consumers will be able to make conscientious decisions about the products that they buy and how they, as consumers, impact the world around them. Thus creating a more robust economy that has less of an impact on the natural world around it.
