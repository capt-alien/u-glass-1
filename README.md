# Intensive-project
Intensive - Make School Intensive Project

This project is a basic starter for a single feature that I want to be in another project called Rose. Rose is a social media application focused on solving issue in your community.

Motivation:
I feel like there's not an app that get people excited to do good things in there area. So I thought maybe if there was a different approach to how these issues where displayed to people then maybe they will be more interested.

Code Structure:
The code structure is based off of the Rotten Tomatoes tutorial we did in class. I wanted to use the technologies we learned so I just simply scraped together the remains of RT.
It uses, express, Handlebars, and MongoDB.

Design:
The design is simple. It's just using bootstrap and theres only a few elements. Not to complex as I was just trying to build a starter.
