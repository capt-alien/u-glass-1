# U-Glass-project
U-Glass - Make School SPD/Intensive Project

This project is a basic starter for a single feature that I want to be in another project called Rose. Rose is a social media application focused on solving issue in your community.

Motivation:
I feel like there's not an app that get people excited to do good things in there area. So I thought maybe if there was a different approach to how these issues where displayed to people then maybe they will be more interested.

Code Structure:
The code structure is based off of the tutorials I did in the BEW 1.1. class. I wanted to use the technologies we learned so I just did my best to emulate what I learned.
It uses, Express, Handlebars, and MongoDB.

Design:
The design is simple. It's just using bootstrap and there's only a few elements. Not to complex as I was just trying to build a starter project.
